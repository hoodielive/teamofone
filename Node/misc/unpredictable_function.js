 * The function uses the cache variable to store the results of different file read operations. 
 * Bear in mind that this is just an example, it does not have error management, and the caching logic itself is
 * suboptimal.
 * Its dangerous because it behaves asynchronously if the cache is not set-which is not until the fs.readFile()
 * function returns its results-but it will also be synchronous for all the subsequent requests for a file already
 * in the cache-triggering an immediate invocation of the callback.
