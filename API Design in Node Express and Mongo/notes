What is Node? 

Platform built on Chrome's V8 engine that can be used out of browser to build tooling and network based applications. 

Created by Ryan Dahl (currently at Google).

Maintained by the Node.js Foundation.

Open Source (good luck trying to contribute to it).

Useb by everyone. 


HTTP in Node 
Node comees with a built in module for creating network based apps. 

Just a Library, not a framework. 

Good luck. 

You still need to develop abstractions around the http module to build servers. 

Do NOT USE THIS MODULE, use EXPRESS! 


Node Server Frameworks 

  - Connect (baseline framework) 
  - Express (based on connet)
  - Koa (from express creators)
  - Hapi
  - Sails (based on express)

Why express? 
 - The go to for creating API's with node
 - Other frameworks are based off express
 - Tons of plugins and integrations 

 Features: 
  - Declarative routing 
    - Exact, pattern, glob, parameter matching 

  - Middleware 
    - Functions to run serially on your requests 

  - Powerful response options 
    - From JSON to static files 
    - Stream
    - Redirects 

  - DB Agnostic 
  
  - Highly configurable 

Getting started: 

const express = require('express'); 

const app = express() 

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
   res.json({ok: true}) 
}); 

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('http://localhost:3000')    
})

Routing with Express

  - Flexible
