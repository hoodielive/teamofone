Stages 

Birth Phase 
  1. Initialize/Construction 
  2. getDefaultProps() or MyComponent.defaultProps (ES6 class)
  3. getInitialState() or this.state = ... (ES6 Constructor)
  4. componentWillMount()
  5. render() 
  6. Children intialization & life cycle kickoff 
  7. componentDidMount() 

- After the initialization of the component instance, we start moving through the birth phase of the 
  React lifecycle

- This phase deals with the 'initial configuration' our Component where we pass (props) that will define
  the instance

- We also configure the 'state' and get access to the initial UI display 

- It also starts the mounting process
